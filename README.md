Caesar Cipher Project

Overview
This project implements a Caesar Cipher, a simple and ancient encryption technique that shifts the letters in a message by a certain number of positions. Our implementation supports not only letter shifting but also includes digits and punctuation, making it a more versatile tool for encryption and decryption.

The Caesar Cipher is presented with an interactive interface allowing users to encrypt, decrypt messages, or perform brute-force decryption to reveal the original message without knowing the key.

Features
Encryption & Decryption: Users can choose to encrypt or decrypt messages using a key they specify.
Brute-Force Decryption: For encrypted messages without a known key, the program offers a brute-force method to try all possible keys.
Support for ASCII Characters: Our implementation extends beyond letters to include digits and punctuation, supporting a broader range of ASCII characters.
How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the program using Python 3.x.
Follow the on-screen instructions to choose between encrypting, decrypting, or brute-forcing a message. You can exit the program at any time by selecting 'Q'.
Credits and Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by and based upon concepts introduced in "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" by Al Sweigart. While the original book presents a foundation for creating simple games and projects including a basic version of the Caesar Cipher, our implementation has been extended to include a wider range of characters and a more user-friendly interactive interface.

My gratitude to Al Sweigart for the educational content provided in his book, which has been instrumental in the development of this project.
